# INX Future Inc Employee Performance Analysis
IABAC Certified Data Scientist Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee performance data from INX Future Inc to identify key factors affecting performance, evaluate department wise trends, and build machine learning models to predict employee performance.

The insights help the organization make informed decisions to improve productivity and employee satisfaction.

## Objectives
1. Analyze department wise employee performance trends.
2. Identify the top three factors affecting employee performance.
3. Build machine learning models to predict employee performance.
4. Compare model performance using accuracy and cross validation scores.
5. Provide data driven recommendations to improve employee performance.

## Dataset
The dataset contains employee information such as:
- Education
- Experience
- Training hours
- Department
- KPIs met
- Awards won
- Performance rating
